    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.

    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.

    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitInitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git init' does.
*/

/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCloneDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git clone' does.

//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////
/*

    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git status' does.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitStatusDefinition = `Git Status shows the status of the folder/directory you are in. Status also shows you what changes have been saved.`;

//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitAddDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git add' does.

    Create another variable called 'gitAddCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to add all files.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitAddDefinition = `Git Add tells our repository to expect to save these files mentioned. We can choose specific files, or everything in a directory.`;
let gitAddCode = `git add .`;


//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCommitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git commit' does.

    Create a variable called 'gitCommitCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to commit using the message "initial commit".
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitCommitDefinition = `Git Commit is taking a snapshot of our project at that moment, and 'saving' it to our local repository, in preparation for pushing out.`;

//////////////////PROBLEM 8////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitPushDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git push' does.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitPushDefinition = `Git Push is most like the actual saving. You upload your updated files, and save them to whatever pathway you've chosen. For our case, we save to GitHub.`;
